SWiFT (Self-weighted Transformer Fusion) is a deep learning model that combines:

Linear Embedding Layer: Transforms input features into a higher-dimensional space.

Transformer Encoder Layers: Captures feature relationships using self-attention mechanisms, useful for understanding dependencies across features (just like in NLP).

Fusion Layer: Performs a weighted fusion of outputs from the transformer.

Classifier Layer: Outputs the final crop class.
